# Challenge 2

You should be able to complete this challenge without opening a Finder/Explorer window. Use your command line as much as possible.

1. Update your forked repository _master_ branch so that it is in line with the blessed repository
1. Copy the _challenge\_2/pjs/_ folder and rename the new folder with your initials (try completing this task using your command line)
1. Use Node.js and NPM to build a simple utility that will minimize the `src/styles.css` file and place the new, minimized file in a new folder named `dist`
1. Create a `README.md` file inside your folder with instructions on how to run your Node script
1. Push your solution to your forked repository
1. Submit a pull request to have your solution added to the blessed repository (**make your commit messages meaningful and unique to your submission**)

Remember to checkout a feature branch in your repository to do all of your work in. I'll post my solution to this challenge before next class.
