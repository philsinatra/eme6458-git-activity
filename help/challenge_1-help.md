# Challenge 1 Help

This challenge requires you to use the [_forking workflow_](https://github.com/philsinatra/IDM-T380/blob/master/instructor_materials/03-git.md#forking) we discussed in class. The general outline of the steps you need to follow to complete this challenge are:

1. Create your own _fork_ of the blessed repository
1. _Clone_ your forked repository to your local system
1. _Checkout_ a feature branch
1. Add your name/emoji to the list
1. _Commit_ your changes to your feature branch
1. _Push_ your feature branch to your remote (on GitHub)
1. Create a _pull request_ on GitHub for me to merge your changes into the blessed repository
