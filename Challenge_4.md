# Challenge 4

Work individually to expand on your Gulp task runner script.

1. Update your fork of [IDM-Git-Practice](https://github.com/philsinatra/IDM-Git-Practice).
1. Copy your team solution from Challenge 3 into a new folder named with your initials in the _challenge\_4_ directory (try to do this using only your command line).
1. Update your Gulp tasks so that every time a change is made to the `./src/stylus/screen.styl` file, not only does Gulp recompile the `.css` file, but it also refreshes the browser automatically so you can see the changes made immediately without have to manually refresh.

Remember to checkout a feature branch in your repository to do all of your work in.

1. Update the `README.md` file inside your folder with instructions on how to run your Node/Gulp script
1. Push your solution to your forked repository
1. Submit a pull request to have your solution added to the blessed repository
