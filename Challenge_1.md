# Challenge 1

Add your name and a descriptive emoji as a bullet item under your team heading.

Example:

- ðŸ’ª Phil Sinatra

We're going to practice the [_forking workflow_](git-workflows.md). Send your change to me (Phil) as a pull request on GitHub. I will act as the _integration manager_ for this challenge. If all members of all teams complete this challenge before class next week, you will all receive an extra credit point towards your final project.

Add your entry under the headings below:

## Alpha Team

## Beta Team

## Charlie Team
