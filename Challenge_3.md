# Challenge 3

Work with your team:

1. Update your forked repository _master_ branch so that it is in line with the blessed repository
1. Copy the _challenge\_3/pjs/_ folder and rename the new folder with your team name (alpha, bravo, charlie) (try completing this task using your command line)

Work as a team to create a Gulp based task runner that will:

- Process your `./src/stylus/screen.styl` file into a compressed `.css` file and place the new file in a folder named `dist/css` within your group folder
- Generate a _sourcemap_ file for your new `.css` file and place it in the same directory as the compressed `.css` file: `dist/css`
- Copy your `./src/views/index.html` file into the `dist` folder

Remember to checkout a feature branch in your repository to do all of your work in.

1. Create a `README.md` file inside your folder with instructions on how to run your Node/Gulp script
1. Push your solution to your forked repository
1. Submit a pull request to have your solution added to the blessed repository
